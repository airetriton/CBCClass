      // Creating an array of vegetables.
      var vegetables = ["Carrots", "Peas", "Lettuce", "Tomatoes"];
      // Looping through each item in the array and logging a message to the console.
      for (var i = 0; i < vegetables.length; i++) {
        console.log("I love " + vegetables[i]);
      }

      //first part of for equation
          step one: var i = 0; 
            i=initial value
          step two: loop conditions i < vegetables.lenght; loop to see what is happening until the value is false, if you used greater than or equal to the last item would be null
          
          step three: i++ can be listed as i=i+1 or i++ this is how it increases in increments of 1

          when all those conditions are met then do the console.log
