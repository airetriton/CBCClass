    // Run this program. Then turn to the person next to you and answer the following questions:
    // 1. What is the difference (in output) between Situation 1 and Situation 2?
    // 2. Why are the alert messages different? (Hint: Look for syntax differences)

    // Situation 1
    // ------------------------------------------
    var myVar1 = 1; //variable declared

    function a1() {  // code won't run until line 28, 
      myVar1 = 5 - 3; //variable being redifined 
      b1();   //calls the function below to run the alert from b1
      alert("Q1 | a: " + myVar1); // will run this alert
    }

    function b1() {
      alert("Q1 | b: " + myVar1);
    }
    a1();


    // Situation 2
    // ------------------------------------------
    var myVar2 = 1; //variable declared globally

    function a2() {  
      var myVar2 = 5 - 3;  //declaring variable (not redefining) locally
      b2();  //when calling this function it can't see the newly declared variable because it is inside the house (locally) and so the funciton b2 cannot see the newly defined variable
      alert("Q2 | a: " + myVar2);
    }

    function b2() {//this is global or outside of the house so it cannot see the var myVar2 that is inside of the function a2
      alert("Q2 | b: " + myVar2);
    }
    a2();
